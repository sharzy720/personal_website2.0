            <p>I have found that a mid-2012 MacBook Pro is the oldest I would go when looking for a cheap laptop. These laptops can usually be found for $100 to $300 on eBay. This is a great price for what you get compared to similarly priced windows laptops. These laptops have an aluminum unibody chassis and decent performance.</p>
